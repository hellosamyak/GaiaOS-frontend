## üéØ The Problem: The Energy Blindspot

Today, for the average citizen, energy is **blind, static, and dumb**. This leads to:
* **No Transparency:** Citizens lack awareness of their energy's source, cost, and carbon footprint.
* **Inefficiency:** There's a major disconnect between peak renewable energy generation (like daytime solar) and peak household demand.
* **No Engagement:** Traditional energy systems offer no tools for citizens to actively manage their consumption or participate in the green energy transition.
